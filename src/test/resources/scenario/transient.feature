Feature: Configure Fabric using SDK and submit/evaluate using a network Gateway
	Background:
		Given I have deployed a tls Fabric network
		And I have created and joined all channels from the tls connection profile
		And I deploy node chaincode named fabcar at version 1.0.0 for all organizations on channel mychannel with endorsement policy 1AdminOr2Other and arguments ["initLedger"]

 	Scenario: Using a Gateway I can send transient data to instantiated node chaincode
		Given I have a gateway as user User1 using the tls connection profile
		And I connect the gateway
		When I prepare a transaction named echoTransient for contract fabcar on network mychannel
		And I set transient data on the transaction to
			| key1 | value1 |
			| key2 | value2 |
		And I evaluate the transaction with arguments []
		Then the response should be JSON matching
		    """
		    {
		    	"key1": "value1",
		    	"key2": "value2"
		    }
		    """
